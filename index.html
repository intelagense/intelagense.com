            <img class="image right fit" src="images/turkey.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              As a highly skilled full-stack software engineer, I bring a wealth
              of experience in building scalable and user-friendly web
              applications. With a diverse background as a former electrcian and
              general contractor, I offer a unique blend of technical expertise
              and project management skills.
            </p>

            <p>
              Throughout my career, I've consistently delivered exceptional
              results, leaving a lasting impact on every project I undertake.
              From developing dynamic client websites to contributing to
              influential open-source projects, I thrive on solving complex
              problems and delivering innovative solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              What sets me apart is not just my technical prowess, but also my
              mindset. I have a passion for getting things done while
              maintaining a sense of humor and levity. I firmly believe that a
              positive and lighthearted approach fosters creativity and
              collaboration, ultimately leading to remarkable outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to my professional pursuits, I lead a well-rounded
              lifestyle that keeps me inspired and balanced. Outside of coding,
              you'll find me exploring new bands and music genres, nurturing a
              vegetable garden to create delicious meals, and embarking on
              exhilarating bike rides through scenic landscapes. I also find
              solace in immersing myself in the captivating worlds of retro
              RPGs. These diverse experiences fuel my creativity and bring me
              joy, allowing me to approach challenges with a fresh perspective.
